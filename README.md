## ðŸ“± Mobile Navigation

- `<div class="hamburger">` toggles visibility of `<nav class="mobile-nav">`
- JavaScript is placed before `</body>` in all pages
- `.top-header` has `position: relative` to correctly anchor dropdown menus

## ðŸ’¡ Custom Styling Notes

- All pages use `section.card` containers for layout
- `.footer-bottom` uses `line-height: 1.3` to fix overlap on small screens
- Mobile nav links avoid hover zoom via:
  ```css
  .mobile-nav a:hover {
    transform: none;
  }
  ```

## âœ¨ Maintenance Tips

- To add a new page, copy an existing HTML structure (e.g., `contact.html`)
- Keep the `<script>` block and `.top-header` layout consistent for mobile nav
- Use `styles.css` for global styles; only use `<style>` in HTML for page-specific overrides
